TMTDyn is a Matlab based package to automate the derivation of TMT Equation of Motion (EOM) for hybrid rigid-continuum body dynamic systems with constraints and contacts, their linear modal analysis, and nonlinear controller design.

To start:
- Choose one of the version folders above (according to the relevant publication date).
- Download the directory Zip-file to begin.
- Matlab Software with Symbolic, Coder, Parallel Computing, and Curve Fitting Toolboxes are required.
- Installing SUNDIALS solvers is optional to use the implemented C wrapper for fast numerical simulation via an external solver.
- Edit and Run the robot implementation file in Matlab.
