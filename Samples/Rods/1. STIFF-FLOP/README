Four modeling assumptions are used to model the static and dynamic motion of a STIFF-FLOP continuum appendage. The system is described in "Manip_v6_2.m" file. You may change the following parameters to run the different implemented models and experimental cases.

study = 1 ; % 1: ROM, 2: Series Rigid Link (SRL), 3: Discretized Relative States (EBR), 4: Discretized Absolute States (EBA)
n_rs = 2 ; % ROM: ROM polynomial order
           % SRL, EBR, EBA: manipulator segments
exp_case = [ 1 1 inf ] ; % [ experiment_case star_sequence end_sequence ]: 1- without external load, 2- with external load
