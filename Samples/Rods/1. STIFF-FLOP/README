Four modeling assumptions are used to model the static and dynamic motion of a STIFF-FLOP continuum appendage. The system is described in "Manip_v6_2.m" file. You may change the following parameters to run the different implemented models and experimental cases.

study = 1 ; % 1: ROM, 2: Series Rigid Link (SRL), 3: Discretized Relative States (EBR), 4: Discretized Absolute States (EBA)
n_rs = 2 ; % ROM: ROM polynomial order
           % SRL, EBR, EBA: manipulator segments
exp_case = [ 1 1 inf ] ; % [ experiment_case star_exp_sequence end_exp_sequence ]: 1- without external load, 2- with external load

The following parameters control different type of available analysis, plotting, and postprocessing.

% derivation
par.derive = 0 ; % set 1 to rederive in TMT
par.derive_collect = 0 ; % collect in 1: single struct., 2: seperte struct.s, 3: seperate func.s, 4: C func.s
par.derive_mex = 1 ; % use Matlab codegen, automatically sets par.derive_collect = 1
par.opv = true ; % optimize results

The system derivations are sometimes time-consuming. The derivations for the four different modeling assumptions are provided in folders named "code (model n_rs)". You may copy their content in the "code" file, change the above parameters accordingly, set par.derive=0, and run the "Manip_v6_2.m" file in Matlab to see the results. Where the folder name has "fixpar" explanation, the structural paramters cannot be changed.
