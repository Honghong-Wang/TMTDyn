"TMTDyn_hll" is a MatLab-Internal DSL (Domain Specific Language) for Modelling Hybrid Rigid–Continuum Robots based on [TMTDyn package](https://github.com/hadisdt/TMTDyn). Our aim is to automate the derivation of TMT Equation of Motion (EOM) for hybrid rigid-continuum body dynamic systems with constraints and contacts, their linear modal analysis, and nonlinear controller design.

We have recently developed a Matlab software package, called [TMTDyn](https://github.com/hadisdt/TMTDyn) to derive TMT EOM of hybrid rigid-continuum body mechanisms ([Sadati et al. preprint](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334084910_TMTDyn_A_Matlab_Package_for_Modeling_and_Control_of_Hybrid_Rigid-Continuum_Robots_Based_on_Discretized_Lumped_System_and_Reduced_Order_Models)), which was based on an earlier version, called [AutoTMTDyn](https://github.com/hadisdt/AutoTMTDyn) for dealing with rigid-body mechanisms ([Sadati et al. 2015](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290003554_An_Automatic_Algorithm_to_Derive_Linear_Vector_Form_of_Lagrangian_Equation_of_Motion_with_Collision_and_Constraint)). 

Here, we introduce a new version, now called "TMTDyn_hll", which is equipped with a MatLab-Internal DSL providing the following benefits:
1) Accessibility: the DSL offers an intuitive structure for describing a robotic system that is automatically broken down into the parts required by the TMTDyn package.
2) Early validation: the DSL can offer validation checks at the time of description rather than the time of evaluation, allowing error messages to be more focused and simplifying debugging.
3) Maintainability: changes to the structure to be modelled can be made easily and in a structured fashion; where the plain TMTDyn package may require careful adjustment of multiple parts of the code, all related changes are closely linked in the DSL.


In the Samples section, we employed this DSL to derive EOM of continuum bodies based on discretized and reduced order solutions:
- a fabric sleeve worn on a rigid-link arm (similar to the one here: [code](https://github.com/hadisdt/TMTDyn/tree/master/Samples/Fabric/2.%20Passive), [Wiki page](https://github.com/hadisdt/TMTDyn/wiki/Example-2--Fabric-dynamics-worn-by-a-rigid-link-pendulum)).

As a result, a unified software package is provided for deriving EOM, control design, and numerical simulation of hybrid rigid-continuum body systems.
